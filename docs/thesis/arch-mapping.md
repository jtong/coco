# A systematic mapping study on the combination of software architecture and agile development

specific activities 

- Architectural Analysis (AA) is aimed at defining the problems an architecture must solve. The outcome of this activity is a set of architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) (Hofmeister et al., 2007).
- Architectural Synthesis (AS) proposes candidate architecture solutions to address the ASRs collected in AA, thus this activity moves from the problem to the solution space (Hofmeister et al., 2007).
- Architectural Evaluation (AE) ensures that the architectural design decisions made are the right ones, and the candidate archi- tectural solutions proposed in AS are measured against the ASRs collected in AA (Hofmeister et al., 2007).
- Architectural Implementation (AI) realizes the architecture by creating a detailed design (Tang et al., 2010).
- Architectural Maintenance and Evolution (AME): Architectural maintenance is to change an architecture for the purpose of fix- ing faults (ISO, 2006, ISO, 2011) and architectural evolution is to respond to new requirements at architectural level (Postma et al., 2004). In this SMS, we simply considered architectural mainte- nance and architectural evolution as one activity, in which an ar- chitecture is changed either to fix faults or to implement new re- quirements.


general activities

- Architectural Recovery (AR) is used to extract the current architecture of a system from the systemâ€™s implementation (Medvidovic and Jakobac, 2006).
- Architectural Description (ADp) is used to describe the architec- ture with a set of architectural elements (e.g., architecture views). This activity can help stakeholders (e.g., architects) to understand the system, and improve the communication and cooperation among stakeholders (ISO, 2011).
- Architectural Understanding (AU) is used to comprehend the ar- chitectural elements (e.g., architectural decisions) and their rela- tionships in an architecture design (Li et al., 2013).
- Architectural Impact Analysis (AIA) is used to identify the ar- chitectural elements, which are affected by a change scenario (Bengtsson et al., 2004). The analysis results include the compo- nents in architecture that are affected directly, as well as the indi- rect effects of changes to the architecture (Bengtsson et al., 2004).
- Architectural Reuse (ARu) aims at reusing existing architectural design elements, such as architecture frameworks, decisions, and patterns in the architecture of a new system (IEEE, 2010).
- Architectural Refactoring (ARf) aims at improving the architec- tural structure of a system without changing its external behavior (Babar et al., 2013; Fowler et al., 1999).
